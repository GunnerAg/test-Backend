# test-Backend
### This was done as a test for a job interview, the goal of the script was to run from the comand line, take two arguments with the name of two files that had data in 2 formats, once the data was reformated the idea was to take some data from each file, and use it to calculate a value of either % or absolute value over a price to output the final benefit or cost of a product, since the company was spanish the coments on the code are in Spanish, therefore I made this README for anyone who wonders what is this about.
